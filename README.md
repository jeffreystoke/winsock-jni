# winsock-jni

JNI Wrapper for WinSock API (under heavy development)

[中文](./README-CN.md)

## Purpose

Give a try for using Java to do something windows native, and learn windows IO model in depth.

(for course net-dev)

## Features

- Windows native socket
- Select IO Model
- WSAEventSelect Model
- Overlapped IO Model
- Completion Port

Note: WSAAsyncSelect is NOT supported, cause it requires WinMain as its entrance

## Usage

Use as other JAR

## Build

0. Get Visual Studio and Java 8 installed, configure `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
1. Modify `native/build.gradle`, change `libs->winsock->headers.srcDir` and other path variables to match your own case
2. run `cd library && ../gradlew fatJar`

Gradle will download essential packages and build, output is `library/build/libs/winsock-jni-{VERSION}.jar`

## Examples

// TODO

## Note

- support Windows Platform only
- support VisualCpp toolchain only
